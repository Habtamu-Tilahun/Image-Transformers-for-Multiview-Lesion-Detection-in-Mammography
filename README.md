# Image-Transformers-for-Multiview-Lesion-Detection-in-Mammography
This repository contains the code from the master's thesis project on image transformers for multiview lesion detection in mammography. The project is part of the final assessment to obtain the joint master's degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA) from the University of Girona (Spain), the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio (Italy), and the University of Bourgogne (France). The work was developed at the Computer Vision and Robotics (ViCOROB) Research Group, University of Girona.

## Project description
This study aimed to investigate the benefits of using transformers for multi-view mass detection in mammographic images, incorporating information from the left and right mammograms as multi-channel input images, and to evaluate and compare their performance to single-image transformers and another traditional object detection method.
