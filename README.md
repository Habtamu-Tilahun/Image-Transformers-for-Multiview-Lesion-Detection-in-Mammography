# Image-Transformers-for-Multiview-Lesion-Detection-in-Mammography
This study aims to investigate the benefits of using transformers for multi-view mass detection in mammographic images, incorporating information from the left and right mammograms as multi-channel input images, and to evaluate and compare their performance to single-image transformers and another traditional object detection method.
